GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's some pseudocode for the `single-product.php`, `cart.php`, and `checkout.php` files:

For `single-product.php`:
1. Check if the current page is a single product page.
2. If it is, load the custom `single-product.php` template.
3. Display the product image, name, price, description, and add to cart button.

For `cart.php`:
1. Check if the current page is the cart page.
2. If it is, load the custom `cart.php` template.
3. Display all the products in the cart along with their quantities and prices.
4. Display the total price of all the products in the cart.
5. Provide an option to update the cart and proceed to checkout.

For `checkout.php`:
1. Check if the current page is the checkout page.
2. If it is, load the custom `checkout.php` template.
3. Display the billing and shipping form for the user to fill out.
4. Display all the products in the cart along with their quantities and prices.
5. Display the total price of all the products in the cart.
6. Provide an option to place the order.

This pseudocode can then be translated into actual PHP code. The specific steps will depend on what you want to achieve with each file.
